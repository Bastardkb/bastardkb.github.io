# Introduction

{: .warning }
This page only applies to the Dilemma V3 and Dilemma MAX V3. If you have any other keyboard, check out the [compile page instead][compile].

The [BastardKB QMK repository](https://github.com/bastardkb/bastardkb-qmk) contains the behavioral firmware code and releases for the Bastard Keyboards Charybdis boards.

The keymaps are stored in the [BastardKB QMK userspace repository][bkbus].

The QMK repository repository is used as primary source of truth for Bastard Keyboards firmwares and contains the latest changes and improvements.
The maintainers aim at upstreaming all those changes to the official [QMK repository](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware).

This page details how to build your own firmware. 
Building from source is useful to people who want to customize their keyboard and keymaps beyond what Via offers. 
You will have to modify the keymap `C` code, and from there compile your firmware either using Github actions or the local command line.

If that seems too complicated, you can also use one of the [release firmware](https://github.com/Bastardkb/qmk_userspace/releases/tag/prerelease) builds.

Right now the code for the Dilemma V3 and Dilemma MAX V3 is not on the master branch of our QMK fork.
This is because we are waiting for features to merge into the main QMK repository, and need to use the `bkb-develop` branch meanwhile.

Because of this, compiling your own image requires some additional steps. Otherwise, the process is quite similar to the regular one.

{: .note }
In this page, we will compile a custom keymap for the `3x5_3` Dilemma V3. If you need to compile an image for the `4x6_4` Dilemma MAX V3, just change the options accordingly.


# Pre-requisites

## BastardKB userspace

While the QMK repository contains the logic behind the keyboards, the keymaps are in the userspace repository.

**If you are going to create your own keymaps, the first step is to fork the [BastardKB QMK userspace repository][bkbus].**


This way, you can:

- track changes
- use Github actions to compile your keymap
- (if relevant) contribute your keymap to the origin Bastard KB QMK Userspace

In a separate folder, clone the fork you just created, using either Github desktop or the command line. Then, switch to the `bkb-develop` branch:


```shell
git clone https://github.com/my_username/qmk_userspace 
cd qmk_userspace
git checkout -b bkb-develop origin/bkb-develop
```

# Creating your keymap

If you want to create your own keymap, **make sure you have forked the [BastardKB QMK userspace repository][bkbus]**, and switched to the `bkb-develop` branch.

Create a separate folder in the relevant folder, eg:

```
keyboards/bastardkb/dilemma/3x5_3_procyon/my-keymap
```


{: .note }
By convention, your keymap name must be all lowercase, without spaces.

Then, the easiest is to copy over an existing keymap (eg. `vendor`) over, and modify from there.

# Compiling your firmware using Github actions

By using github actions, you can have Github compile your firmware without having to bother with a local QMK installation and console commands.

## Pre-requisites {#actions-requirements}

If you want to use Github actions to compile your firmware (rather than doing it locally in the console), you will need to:

- fork the [BastardKB QMK userspace repository][bkbus]
- switch to the `bkb-develop` branch
- **in the `Actions` tab, enable workflows**

If you switched to the `bkb-develop` branch, then your userspace is already pointing to the `bkb-develop` branch of our QMK fork. This is where the code for the Dilemma/MAX V3 is stored.

## Compiling your firmware

First, make sure you have gone through the [Github actions requirements section above](#actions-requirements).

After cloning the BastardKB userspace repository, it is already configured to work with the BastardKB QMK fork - so no need for additional configuration on that side.

Once you created your own keymap, you will need to add it to the list of keymaps to be compiled in `qmk.json`, for example:

```shell
{
    "userspace_version": "1.0",
    "build_targets": [
        ["bastardkb/dilemma/3x5_3_procyon", "my-keymap"]
    ]
}
```

We also recommend deleting the other keymaps if you don't use them, as it'll make the action run faster.

Then,

1. Push your changes above to your forked GitHub repository
1. Look at the GitHub Actions for a new actions run
1. Wait for the actions run to complete
1. Inspect the Releases tab on your repository for the latest firmware build


# Compiling your firmware using the local command line

You can also compile your firmware through your local command line. This requires you to be familiar with the console, and doing some additional configuration.

## Pre-requisites

### Working QMK environment

Make sure you have a functional QMK environment. See [QMK Docs](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs) for details. At this point, **you don't need** to run `qmk setup`.

### BastardKB QMK fork

Clone the BKB QMK repository, using either github desktop or the command line, and switch to the `bkb-develop` branch:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bastardkb/bastardkb-qmk
cd bastardkb-qmk
git checkout -b bkb-develop origin/bkb-develop
qmk git-submodule
```

Now that you've cloned the repository, set it as the default local QMK repository. You also need to do this if you had a previous, separate QMK installation.

```shell
qmk config user.qmk_home="$(realpath .)" 
```

{: .info }
If you have multiple QMK installations, you will need to manually set the qmk home path again to use the other ones.

That's all you needed to do with the QMK repository.
From here on, **we will only focus on the userspace repository.**

### QMK Userspace

Next, `cd` into your userspace fork and enable userspace:

```shell
qmk config user.overlay_dir="$(realpath .)"
```

## Compiling your firmware

Once in the QMK userspace repository, compiling a keymap works the same as normal. For example:

```shell
qmk compile -c -kb bastardkb/dilemma/3x5_3_procyon -km my_keymap
```

# Flashing your keyboard

Once you compiled your `uf2` image, you can flash your keyboard.

For how to flash your keyboard, take a look at the [how to flash your keyboard page][flashing].
