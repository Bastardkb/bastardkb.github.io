# Preparing the 3d holder assembly
## Top housing - screw inserts

![](../assets/pics/guides/cnano/39.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**

- 3d printed top housing (x1)
- M3 screw insert (x3)

{: .tip }
There are 2 sizes of screw inserts in your kit. In this step, we will use the small ones.

- Install the 3 screw inserts
- **Use the same method as for the case**
- Let gravity do the work
- Push it 2/3 of the way in, then flip it and push flush against a flat surface

## Bottom housing - screw inserts

![](../assets/pics/guides/charybdis/53.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**

- 3d printed bottom housing (x1)
- M3 screw insert (x2)

{: .tip }
There are 2 sizes of screw inserts in your kit. In this step, we will use the small ones.

{: .note }
Depending on your kit, the bottom housing might look slightly different. The process to prepare it and install it is the same. 

- Inspect the bottom housing: there are 3 holes with a chamfer, and 2 holes without.
- For the screw inserts, **we will use the 2 holes without chamfers**
- Use the picture below for reference

- Install the 2 screw inserts
- Use the same method as for the case
- Let gravity do the work
- Push it 2/3 of the way in, then flip it and push flush against a flat surface

## Bottom housing - bearings

![](../assets/pics/guides/charybdis/55.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**

- 3d printed bottom housing (x1)
- M3 screw (x3)
- M3 bearing (x3)

**For each of the 3 bearings:**

- Install the bearing in its spot
- Screw in the M3 torx screw
- Make sure it can rotate freely. If not, unscrew by half a turn and check again

# Spin the ball
- If you printed the case yourself, the bearings might scratch a bit against the 3d print and not roll correctly
- Rest the trackball on top of the 3 bearings
- Place your palm on top of the trackball
- Applying gentle pressure, make a circle movement, make sure you can hear the bearings rotating
- Do this for around 30 seconds, or until the trackball feels smooth

# Soldering the sensor PCB to the Splinky Shield

![](../assets/pics/guides/charybdis/69.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**
- keyboard assembly
- sensor PCB assembly

Inspect the Splinky shield: there is a `SPI` header, that we need to connect to the sensor PCB.
- match the 3v3 with the 5V
- the rest of the pins will align

Install the cable and solder it just like the other ones. Make sure to match the labels.

# Placing the sensor PCB

Remove the lens:

{: .note }
You may choose to remove the Kapton tape, or leave it on. It doesn't make a difference during use of the trackball.

Guide the sensor through the hole in the 3d print:

# Installing the 3d holder assembly


## Top part

![](../assets/pics/guides/cnano/52.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**
- top sensor assembly

Slide the left side of the top sensor assembly into the case:

Push in the right part:

## Bottom part

{: .tip }
Depending on your kit, the bottom housing might look slightly different. Install the screws to match the picture below.

![](../assets/pics/guides/cnano/55.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**
- right keyboard assembly
- bottom sensor assembly
- m3 screw (x3)

Install the bottom sensor assembly:
- Screw in the 3 screws
- **Make sure the the part is oriented towards the keyboard.** Use the picture below for reference
- Make sure it's tight, but do not overtighten - you might damage the print
- The whole assembly should not move at all

# Installing the sensor PCB and protective cover    

In this final step, we will screw in the sensor PCB and its protective cover.

![](../assets/pics/guides/cnano/56.jpg)

**For the following step, please prepare:**
- right keyboard assembly
- sensor cover
- m3 screw (x2)

Install the sensor PCB and cover:

- Install the sensor PCB on top of the holder, aligning the two holes of the PCB with the two holes of the holder
- Screw in the sensor PCB using 2 M3 torx screws
- Use the picture below for reference
