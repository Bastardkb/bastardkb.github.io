# Introduction

In this page, we detail how to get a great Dactyl print.
This information applies to the **Bastard Keyboard designs**, so your mileage may vary for other models.

{: .warning }
Our keyboards are complex models. While we did our best to make them less difficult to print, we **strongly** recommend to print a few tests beforehand to test support separation, surface quality, and bed adhesion.

# Material choice

- Do some test prints with different plastics to see which one works best for you.
- PLA is easiest to print.
- Plastics with patterns in it works best - eg. Prusament Galaxy or Fillamentum Extrafill.

# Print settings

## Temperature

Printing at lower temperatures makes the plastic more matte rather than glossy. We recommend 195 to 210C for PLA, depending on your plastic.

## For Prusa printers

If you are using a prusa printer, print in:

- 0.15mm structural profile
- supports on build plate only
- support type: grid (important!)
- nozzle temperature: 200 for MK3, MK3.5, MK4. 210 for MK4S

## For other printers

The following settings were tested on a BambuLabs A1 Mini and worked well.
They were worked from the `0.16mm High Quality` profile in Bambu Studio.

# Bed adhesion

Dactyls take a long time to print, so it's important to ensure good bed adhesion.

This will depend on your printer - if you have experience with it and are sure that it'll adhere properly, go ahead. It's still recommended to **stick around for the first few layers**, to check that the print is not warping. If the print warps, it will be visible during the final build, or may even (for plates and tents) prevent installation completely!

If your print does not stick, here are a few pointers:
- Add a brim, of 5 or 6 mm
- Use glue - paper glue or wood glue diluted with water works well
- Disable the parts fan for the first layer
- Make sure your bed is leveled correctly

# Part orientation

All the keyboard cases need to be printed in the same orientation they will be used.
